# Exercises - Version Control with git
SS 2016
HU Berlin


1.	Get the course material

    1. Create a Github account and fork this repository
    2. clone your fork of this repository to your local folder

2. Go to the `01_introduction/` directory and create a new file in which you can save your notes. Let's call it `notes.md` and save something in it. If you use markdown syntax like:
  ```
  # Title
  ## Subtitle
  This is some text.
  ```
  you will get it formatted automatically on Github and many other places. Very handy!
3. add this file to the repo and commit it.
4. If you forked the repository previously you can now push it to your Github accout.
